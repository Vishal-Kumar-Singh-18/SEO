Q. Define favicon and give an illustrative example.

A favicon, short for "favorite icon," is a small, customized icon that represents a website or a web page. When you visit a website, you often see this small icon displayed in the browser's address bar, next to the website's name in bookmarks or favorites, and sometimes in the tabs of your browser.

Favicons serve several purposes:

1. Branding: Favicons reinforce the visual identity of a website and help users recognize the site more easily among a multitude of open tabs or bookmarks.

2. Professionalism: Having a favicon gives a website a more polished and professional appearance, enhancing the user experience.

3. Visual Reference: Favicons provide a visual reference for users, especially when they have multiple tabs open, making it easier to identify and switch to the desired website quickly.

Here's an illustrative example of how you can define a favicon in the HTML `<head>` section of a web page:

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">

<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>My Website</title>
    <!-- Favicon Definition -->
    <link rel="icon" href="favicon.ico" type="image/x-icon">
    <!-- Alternative Favicon Definition for Different File Types -->
    <link rel="apple-touch-icon" sizes="180x180" href="apple-touch-icon.png">
    <link rel="icon" type="image/png" sizes="32x32" href="favicon-32x32.png">
    <link rel="icon" type="image/png" sizes="16x16" href="favicon-16x16.png">
    <link rel="manifest" href="site.webmanifest">
</head>

<body>
    <!-- Website Content Goes Here -->
</body>

</html>
